Chronic Diseases

Chronic diseases are long-lasting conditions that often require ongoing medical attention and can limit daily activities. They typically develop slowly and persist for months or years. Common examples include diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases (such as asthma and COPD), and chronic kidney disease. These conditions are major contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in resource-constrained healthcare settings. Early prediction and management are crucial to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs
