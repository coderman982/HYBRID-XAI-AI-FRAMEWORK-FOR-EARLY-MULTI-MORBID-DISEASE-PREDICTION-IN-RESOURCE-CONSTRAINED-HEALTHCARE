# Hybrid XAI — Multi‑Disease Prediction (Lightweight)

Hybrid XAI is a lightweight framework for early multi‑morbidity disease risk prediction optimized for resource‑constrained healthcare settings. It combines a small Random Forest multi‑output model with simple clinical rule‑based checks and generates human‑readable explanations.
