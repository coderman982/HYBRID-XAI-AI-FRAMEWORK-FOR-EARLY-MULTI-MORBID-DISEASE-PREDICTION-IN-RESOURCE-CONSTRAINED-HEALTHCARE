# Face Recognition Attendance System

## 📌 Overview

The **Face Recognition Attendance System** is a web-based application that automates attendance marking using facial recognition technology. It eliminates the need for manual attendance and provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for teachers and students.

This project is specially designed for **rural schools**, optimized to run on **low-resource computers** with minimal requirements. It ensures accessibility and ease of use even in areas with limited technical infrastructure.

The system leverages **PHP** for backend logic, **MySQL** for database management, and **face-api.js** models for face detection, recognition, and expression analysis.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd face
```

### 2. Setup Database

1. Create a MySQL database (e.g., `attendance_system`).
2. Import the schema:

   ```sql
   source database/attendance-db.sql;
   ```
3. Update **`database_connection.php`** with your DB credentials.

### 3. Configure Web Server

* Place project inside your PHP server root (e.g., `htdocs/` for XAMPP).
* Ensure **PHP 7+** and **MySQL** are running.

### 4. Setup Student Images

Follow [SETUP_STUDENT_IMAGES.md](./SETUP_STUDENT_IMAGES.md) for guidelines on preparing training images.

### 5. Access Application

Open in browser:

```
http://localhost/face/
```
